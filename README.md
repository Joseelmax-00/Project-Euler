# Project Euler solutions
## SPOILER ALERT: This repository contains the code used to solve all problems in projecteuler.net. So if you don't wanna see the solutions then don't keep reading, please press ALT+F4, turn off your computer and close your eyes. 

I started this project 4 years ago and just stopped working towards that goal. It's not the most impressive stuff right now, AI could provide all solutions at once, but I'll retake that goal as a personal effort. It would be impossible for me to prove that ChatGPT wasn't used to do this, in any case I'll limit myself to Google Search, I will not (and did not) use any AI for any code in this repository.
